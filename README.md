# sha1_extension

For the original version see www.jtolds.com/sha1

Special thanks to JT Olds, for the original code and for making a webpage that inspired me to make a chrome extension.

## NOTES
The new version of this extension includes a fair amount of changes to make the sha1 more secure. So, it will not 
give the same outputs as the original www.jtolds.com/sha1 code
